The extension transfers data using the backend at https://github.com/prodzpod/stream . 

To test the extension, install the extension in any channel and press the screen while it is live.
You can monitor the clicks at https://heat.prod.kr/[Channel Name] (http://heat.prod.kr/prodzpod in this case).
You can also click in the monitor page to send a dummy input as if you clicked the live extension screen.

The clicks are then sent to all active instances of wss://heat.prod.kr/[Channel Name] in a human readable JSON format.
