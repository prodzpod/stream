    h1 The Lore 
    c Testing in Prod 0
    h2 the incident
    p: b VOD unrecoverable - sorry!
    p since prod is korea, Twitch Korea doesnt save VODs despite the setting being on and therefore it is gone. i will recap as detailed as possible to compensate.
    br
    p after 1(+5/7) week of unhealthy gamer development, prod finally goes live for the first* time. and then everything goes to shit after.
    br
    p chat stops working after the 10th message, everyone shows up as "prodzpod" (this is technically lore accurate maybe), prod haven't finished making the 3d model thing so its just a png (that doesnt move, worse than a pngtuber), everythings messed up.
    br
    img(src="https://prod.kr/images/lore/0-1.png")
    p most of the discussions remains as part of the twitch-discord bridge that thankfully mostly worked.
    br
    p prod complains about how they "planned everything and its all fucked up", then tries to showcase the gizmo, and then the stream dies upon !login. they boot it back up only for it to go off again when someone else tries logging in.
    br
    p they fix like 1 minor issue and then the voice gives in because they were singing vocaloid songs while coding that entire week. they get sleeby and end stream like 90 minutes in. we raided <a href="https://twitch.tv/tyumici">tyumici</a>.
    c Testing in Prod 1
    h2 prod z fighting 
    yt mzi5EmdsbXU
    yt 6xUubvDXpTc
    p the debut stream happened. the model style appears, the gizmo is shown off, and some introduction happens.
    p we also discover the modal of "z-fighting", which probably will be a core part of the broadcast.
    p plenty of errors happen, and the creature gets sent to various inaccessible locations frequently. also the window title is broken. lol.
    p we raid <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/exodrifter_">exodrifter_</a> after talking about how i was tired when i first joined her stream and was kinda annoying lol
    c Testing in Prod 2
    h2 being The Wired is a gender
    yt Qv6LhbSdpS8
    p today's accessory is a hastily put together "mushroom witch hat". the concept of a weekly accessory is brought up. the powerpoint docket becomes a regular thing after the positive reception from the first stream. 
    p pose system is shown off as well. the "cyberspace graph mode" is shown off, describing each corners of the gayness scale and softwareline meter.
    img(src="https://prod.kr/images/lore/2-1.png")
    p we also create the first ever general redeem: <button>!removetriangle [number]</button>, that removes a random number of triangles from the creature. creature becomes shambles quickly.
    p the websocket zone was bugged to hell though, spamming "what???" (also known as inaccessible code mode).
    p we talk about the progenitors, john react to the -1st session of prodzpod v scenario (the serendipidous collab) within <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/imgeiser">imgeiser</a>, and raid <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/digi_shell">digi_shell</a> with lcolonq in the chat, completing the trifecta.
    c Testing in Prod 3
    h2 all of the streams budget went to infra team
    yt Ng8ZIi4BRJI
    p we lay out our Grand Plan - the temporal list. the eternal formula to HAPPINESS, some may say. the details of this list is still changing and growing with the input of all of you, so please comment if you have a sick idea or feel like some priority shifting is needed.
    b SEASON 0: testing in prod 
    p we set up the infrastructure necessary to move forward: economy, emotes, achievements, and font renderer is in order.
    b SEASON 1: "z-fighting era"
    p we will be making chatters into customizable "desktop buddies" that can fight each other and roam around the screen.
    p we will also make prod desktop buddy into a real executable you can all utilize in your personal computer.
    p we will also try to move away from javascript, learning various new languages and trying them out by swapping parts of our infrastructure with one written with the new language.
    b EXTRA: "leveling up"
    p "level up"s will be an expensive redeem that multiple people have to redeem to activate. this is done as a way to gauge the sustainability of the broadcast.
    p upon "leveling up", major additions will happen to the stream. this can be a shift in schedule, some new major goal or format, or some kind of special events.
    p in terms of what we did today, we yapped for <b>4 hours</b> and then played a bit of noita. we raided <a href="https://twitch.tv/UWOSLAB">the slab</a> i think
