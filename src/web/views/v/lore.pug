    p TIP: Click the <u>underlined text</u> to <em>/ponder/</em>...
    h1 The Lore 
    p Welcome to <em>the pod</em>, see the <a href="https://prod.kr/v">v page</a> for the setting and introduction of myself but we do go live every <em class='time'>Thursday 20:00 GMT</em> and <em class='time'>Monday 20:00 GMT</em>.
    p we give way too much control to the viewers, talk in an unapologetically insane manner and <u><s>barely</s> somewhat program</u>.
    h2 The Gizmo
    p one of the main feature of the broadcast is the high-effort homemade gizmo (the Monstrous Project) we have going on. the source of this project is available under <a href="https://github.com/prodzpod/stream">github</a>.
    h3 The Chat
    p since the beginning of Season 1, various bbcode-like syntax can be used to markup your text.
    p basic syntax is <em>&lt;item key=value key2=value2&gt;text&lt;/&gt;</em>. notice the lack of label on the closing tag. tags that do not require a closing tag is labeled "self-closing". all key-values are optional and can be omitted. default value is shown for this documentation.
    ul
        li: p <em>&lt;reset&gt;</em>: resets any text modification.
        li: p <em>&lt;br&gt;</em>: (self-closing) adds a newline (useful in twitch).
        li: p <em>&lt;b&gt;</em>: makes the text bold (only supported by corresponding fonts).
        li: p <em>&lt;i&gt;</em>: makes the text italic (only supported by corresponding fonts).
        li: p <em>&lt;u&gt;</em>: puts underline on text.
        li: p <em>&lt;s&gt;</em>: puts strikethrough on text.
        li: p <em>&lt;color=#000000&gt;</em>: sets the color of the text.
        li: p <em>&lt;tilt=0&gt;</em>: makes the text tilted (character by character).
        li: p <em>&lt;size=26&gt;</em>: sets the font size.
        li: p <em>&lt;charspace=0&gt;</em>: sets the number of extra pixels between characters.
        li: p <em>&lt;lineheight=1&gt;</em>: sets the line height multiplier.
        li: p <em>&lt;font=arcaoblique&gt;</em>: sets the font. see <em>!font</em> for the list of fonts.
        li: p <em>&lt;wave amp=4 period=16 freq=1&gt;</em>: makes the text wave up and down.
        li: p <em>&lt;shake amp=1&gt;</em>: makes the text shaky.
        li: p <em>&lt;sprite=blank x=0 y=0&gt;</em>: insert a sprite as if it is text, taking up the specified amount of space. (this is meant to be used in games as we're making it a game engine, may not work great in chat)
    h3: a(href="https://prod.kr/discord") The Discord 
    p Our discord has a single channel (kind of) and is fully connected with Twitch Chat. by logging in within discord, you can also execute twitch commands within the discord server. type <em>!login</em> in discord to link your discord account with twitch.
    p Additionally, thanks to <a href="https://colonq.computer">our progenitor</a>, the same channel is also <u>available under IRC</u> through <em>colonq.computer:26697</em> (over TLS) at <em>#prodarea</em> channel.
    p you can also use the stream commands FROM colonq.computer irc via <em>!loginirc</em>.
    h3: a(href="https://prod.kr/v/screen") The Screen
    p The Screen is a replication of the broadcast where you can interact with the desktop. after logging in via typing the !login command on the twitch chat, you can utilize the screen in various ways.
    p <em>point</em>: make a pointer on screen. when used over prod, it does the twitch headpat thing.
    p <em>click</em>: click on the screen. this can be used to straighten or close windows, turn prod into 2d, or drop chat window into z-fighting hell.
    p <em>fling</em>: drag windows and prod around, throw chat messages and windows as well.
    p <em>spawn window</em>: spawns a window with title and content. you can also spawn a special window by typing <em>Joel</em> or using the <em>!song</em> command.
    p <em>spawn draw window</em> / <em>draw</em>: opens a window that allows you to draw.
    p <em>pin</em>: makes an element immune from gravity and killing, broken upon fling.
    p <em>kill</em>: removes all windows in this position.
    p <em>remove triangle</em>: removes a random triangle from prod (3d).
    p <em>song</em>: spawns a media window that plays song based on a superset of <a href="https://pub.colonq.computer/~bezelea/bells/">Bells of Bezelea</a> that supports <u>multiple instruments and some extra compression</u>.
    p <em>furrow the mare of eidola</em>: "chase idol dream", creates a window of your profile picture on stream.
    p <em>gravity</em>: throws all open windows and objects into one direction.
    p <em>change palette/accessory</em>: toggles palette swap and accessories.
    p <em>change camera</em>: make the perspective different.
    h3 Twitch Commands
    p All the screen commands can also be used in twitch chat directly without logging in (TBD). we also have some extra commands.
    p <em>!boosts [person] / !clonkspotleaderboard [page]</em>: shows clonkspotting info, see <a href="">the pubnix page</a> for details/downloads.
    p <em>!vote &lt;option&gt; / !bet &lt;option&gt; &lt;amount&gt;</em>: participate in vote/prediction.
    p <em>!volume &lt;0 to 1&gt;</em>: sets the volume of gizmo.
    p <em>!randomize</em>: randomizes the palette and accessories.
    p <em>!unlockicon</em>: unlocks a random icon with <em>4000 iu</em>. can also be accessed in screen via the left menu.
    p <em>!shareicon &lt;person&gt;</em>: gift your currently equipped icon set to selected user. costs 2500 iu.
    p <em>!tranquility</em>: omm...
    p <em>!flip</em>: flips the column between left and right.
    h3 Shimeji Commands
    p this is your primary representation of yourself on screen, it inherits your chat behaviour as its AI, you can customize its stats and appearance, and it battles with other shimejis. currently not much can be done with it as we haven't properly started season 1.
    p <em>spawn shimeji</em>: spawns your "little guy". can be customized by sending your spritesheet in #help (!discord).
    p <em>move shimeji</em>: sets the target destination your shimeji will attempt to move towards.
    p <em>!attack &lt;person&gt;</em>: initiates a guy combat between you and selected person. both people must have guy out.
    p <em>!peace &lt;person&gt;</em>: stops fighting person's guy.
    p <em>!stat [person]</em>: views the stat of you or the selected persons guy.
    p <em>jump shimeji</em>: queue up a jump to dodge enemies during combat.
    p <em>spawn fan/antifan</em>: spawns a physics object that affects shimejis.
    p <em>!levelup [hp/attack/crit]</em>: spend stat points (gained upon winning fights) to become stronger (until death).
    h3 Information Commands
    p various information.
    p <em>!inst</em>: lists the instruments you can use for <em>!song</em> (see that for details).

    p <em>!ping [module]</em>: check the connectivity of each module.
    p <em>!commands</em>: shows the list of commands.
    p <em>!takeout</em>: exports your current "chatter data".
    h2 The actual glossary part of the website 
    p due to prod's insane speeches, we get some words that might be wholly unintelligible for many. this is a compilation.
    p a lot of prod's speeches are from the <a href="https://pub.colonq.computer/~prod/toy/glossary#learn-the-language">progenitor zone</a>, please refer to the appropriate section in the glossary there (also written by me).
    ul 
        li <em>"core"</em>: short of "this is me core", something that you are aesthetically attracted to.
        li <em>floor</em>: a short, more stoic version of losing status (most likely VIP). "falling to the floor (of social hierarchy)"
        li <em>symphony of the night</em> / <em>something of this nature</em> / <em>sotn</em>: can mean whatever it wants it to mean.
        li <em>The Graph</em>: the graph of cyberspace streamers with "software and game development" as x axis and "gay energy" as y axis. this is also where <em>less code more gay</em> (where prod is situated at) comes from.
        li <em>Let's see if this is true or rubbish / Vote now in your mobile devices</em>: a mutation of "chat is this real".
        li <em>ydwc</em> / <em>yellow duck with cigarette</em>: the <a href="https://7tv.app/emotes/630db7e07b84e74996da9552">"classic" emoji for 7tv.</a>
        li <em>witscord</em> (or wcord): the mystical land where prod steals all their jokes from (referred to as <em>witpost</em> / <em>wp</em>). the best of them can be found in <a href="https://mas.to/@witscord">masting done</a>.
        li: ul 
            li <em>stazzy</em>: wcord variant of the northernlion "+2", 5 stazzies puts the post on <em>n-stazzy</em>, a starboard equivalent. as opposed to "<em>stizzy</em>".
            li <em>elephant</em>: 5 elephant emojis puts your post in <em>the pipe</em>, a <a href="https://mas.to/@witscord">mastodon bot</a>, originally for puzzle showcase kinda purposes but became similar to stazzy. as opposed to <em>mammoth</em>, neutral offshoots include <em>ox</em>, <em>hippo</em> and basically every four legged animals.
            li <em>casual-two</em>: channel that usually has the best jokes/deepest discussions.
            li <em>1d1p</em> (or one day one puzzle): "weekly" "puzzle" "competition" for thinky kids, a wcord puzzlemaking and solving event where people submit puzzles. see <a href="https://onedayonepuzl.web.app/">the 1d1p website</a> for puzzles.
            li <em><a href="https://looksy.kro.kr/">looksy</a></em>, <em><a href="https://alith.itch.io/what-the-witness">wtw</a></em>, <em><a href="https://beesnation.github.io/witness">beesnation</a></em> and <em><a href="https://thejonymyster.neocities.org/">lopsy</a></em>: custom symbols clone of witness by various wcord members.
            li <em>cryptic crossword</em>: a variant of crossword where clues follow a specific formula. if you see a (number), this is most likely what theyre referring to.
            li <em>no point to the game</em>: referring to a scene in Indie Game: The Movie where johnathan blow cries in darkness because soulja boy said there is no point to braid.
            li: p we also use a lot of simpleflips and nl references because thats basically where witscord gets their jokes from
            li: ul
                li <em>-ma</em>: originates from ligma, its now on everything
                li <em>meteor happens</em>: from the xqc debate on big bang or pangrea, sometimes we quote the whole thing
                li <em>+2 / -2</em>: i dont think this is originally an nl bit but we mostly take it from there
                li <em>type A/B chatter</em>: refers to chatter who is actively participating in the content versus someone who is not
        li <em>John X</em> / <em>X andy</em>: not necessarily our words but we use it quite excessively, meaning "owner of X" and "consumer of X"

    p The One and Only Season we are in currently. we focus on getting the core part of the stream up (channel points, emotes, and basic redemptions). we stream once a day for 2 hours, no collabs, no wacky events. however this promise does not last long as we do stream more than once a day and more than 2 hours and collabs and wacky events basically every week lmao.

            p currently on <em>Season 1</em>, on thursdays, we mostly work on <em>The Gizmo</em>, our overlay/stream thing. see below for the extent of what it does.
            h3 Game Dev
            p we are currently on an arc to complete <a href="https://prodzpod.itch.io/startellers">Startellers</a>, my videogame project that needs to be completed til like this year at the very least. we do that on mondays often.

            h3 How to Join IRC
            p see <a href="https://pub.colonq.computer/~fabius/pages/irc.html">the pubnix guide</a> by noted clonkhead fabius for how to join IRC.
            h3 Twitch Chat is actually IRCv3 
            p this also means we have <em>IRC to IRC communication</em> kind of (right now stream chat doesnt get picked up by clonk irc, but the other way works and discord gets picked up by both).

            ul 
                li basic structure is something like <em>[instrument][global modifier][notes]</em> separated by the <em>|</em> (vertical bar) character.
                li currently available instruments are <em>sine</em>, <em>tri</em>, <em>sq50</em> and <em>drum</em>. when instruments are not provided (such as the original bells text), it defaults to <em>sine</em>.
                li global modifiers apply to every notes in this track. by default, C is C4, and BPM is 75.
                li: ul 
                    li octave control: <em>'</em> increases default octave by 2, <em>,</em> decreases by 2 and <em>"</em> increases by 1. this can be combined like <em>",</em> to -1 octave.
                    li bpm control: <em>;</em> to double bpm, <em>:</em> to triple, <em>-</em> to half bpm, <em>=</em> to third. manually typing numbers bells style works as well.
                    li microtones support: <em>%</em> followed by number to set equal temperment that starts on C. for example, <em>%31</em> (31EDO) would make <em>C~F6#</em> a single octave.
                    li <em>&amp;</em> copies the previous track's global modifiers. useful for multi tracks with same bpm.
                    li <em>.</em> is a blank modifier, and is used to separate instrument from notes. when instrument name is blank, the song gets saved as the "notes" as a title. the song such as <em>.title|sine.[notes...]</em> can be later used like <em>!song title</em> as a shorthand.
                li notes are composed of the tone and modifiers. <em>[</em> character creates a group of tones that plays at the same time and all gets the same modifier. for example, <em>[CEG=</em> plays a 3 beat long C major chord.
                    li available notes are <em>C D E F G A B</em>, black keys can be expressed by <em>C# D# F# G# A#</em> or alternatively <em>X S R T Q</em> as shorthand. rests are expressed as <em>/</em>.
                    li lowercase letters are uppercase letters +1 octaves.
                    li there's also <em>J K L M N H I</em> as C3~B3, <em>Y U O P W</em> as C#3~A#3, <em>j k l m n h i</em> as C6~B6 and <em>y u o p w</em> as C#6~A#6. 
                    li octave control from global modifier also works here, but also bells-style number notation works (<em>C#2</em> is the same as <em>X,</em>)
                    li beats control from global modifier works as well, with <em>;:</em> shortening the beats and <em>-=</em> lengthening it. <em>C;=</em> would be 1.5 beats, and 0.3 seconds on 75 BPM (default).
                    li beats can also be added or deleted arithmetically by <em>+</em>, <em>~</em> (addition) or <em>_</em> (subtraction). where every term begins with 1 beat. <em>C++</em> becomes "C for 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 beats", <em>C=+_:-</em> becomes "C for 3 + 1 - 2/3 = 10/3 beats".
                    li much like octaves, beats can be specified by <em>@</em> followed by a number. like <em>C#@5.5</em>.
                    li <em>&lt;</em> and <em>&gt;</em> drops the attack and release of each note respectively, allowing for slide type action.
                    li <em>!</em> is a special modifier in that the note doesn't "advance the staff line", allowing for notes to overlap with different note lengths and whatnot without multi tracks. see the blank arpeggio (<em>W@12!/C@11!/S@10!/Q@9 P@12!/C@11!/S@10!/T@9</em>) as an example.
                    li <em>?</em> is a special note (NOT a modifier) that takes in global modifier as a modifier. this changes the global modifier mid staff, allowing for bpm shifts and such.
                    li <em>]</em> stops modifiers (exists for bells compat).

            p since prod is korea, Twitch Korea doesnt save VODs despite the setting being on and therefore it is gone. i will recap as detailed as possible to compensate.
            p after 1(+5/7) week of unhealthy gamer development, prod finally goes live for the first* time. and then everything goes to shit after.
            p chat stops working after the 10th message, everyone shows up as "prodzpod" (this is technically lore accurate maybe), prod haven't finished making the 3d model thing so its just a png (that doesnt move, worse than a pngtuber), everythings messed up.
            img(src="https://prod.kr/images/lore/0-1.png")
            p most of the discussions remains as part of the twitch-discord bridge that thankfully mostly worked.
            p prod complains about how they "planned everything and its all fucked up", then tries to showcase the gizmo, and then the stream dies upon !login. they boot it back up only for it to go off again when someone else tries logging in.
            p they fix like 1 minor issue and then the voice gives in because they were singing vocaloid songs while coding that entire week. they get sleeby and end stream like 90 minutes in. we raided <a href="https://twitch.tv/tyumici">tyumici</a>.
        .card
            p the debut stream happened. the model style appears, the gizmo is shown off, and some introduction happens.
            p we also discover the modal of "z-fighting", which probably will be a core part of the broadcast.
            p plenty of errors happen, and the creature gets sent to various inaccessible locations frequently. also the window title is broken. lol.
            p we raid <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/exodrifter_">exodrifter_</a> after talking about how i was tired when i first joined her stream and was kinda annoying lol
        .card 
            p today's accessory is a hastily put together "mushroom witch hat". the concept of a weekly accessory is brought up. the powerpoint docket becomes a regular thing after the positive reception from the first stream. 
            p pose system is shown off as well. the "cyberspace graph mode" is shown off, describing each corners of the gayness scale and softwareline meter.
            img(src="https://prod.kr/images/lore/2-1.png")
            p we also create the first ever general redeem: <button>!removetriangle [number]</button>, that removes a random number of triangles from the creature. creature becomes shambles quickly.
            p the websocket zone was bugged to hell though, spamming "what???" (also known as inaccessible code mode).
            p we talk about the progenitors, john react to the -1st session of prodzpod v scenario (the serendipidous collab) within <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/imgeiser">imgeiser</a>, and raid <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/digi_shell">digi_shell</a> with lcolonq in the chat, completing the trifecta.
        .card 
            p today's accessory is a halo thing, its got stars in it, brb screen was introduced here, as well as proper window tracking by obs (this is the thing in the episode 1 video)
            p we lay out our Grand Plan - the temporal list. the eternal formula to HAPPINESS, some may say. the details of this list is still changing and growing with the input of all of you, so please comment if you have a sick idea or feel like some priority shifting is needed.
            b SEASON 0: testing in prod 
            p we set up the infrastructure necessary to move forward: economy, emotes, achievements, and font renderer is in order.
            b SEASON 1: "z-fighting era"
            p we will be making chatters into customizable "desktop buddies" that can fight each other and roam around the screen.
            p we will also make prod desktop buddy into a real executable you can all utilize in your personal computer.
            p we will also try to move away from javascript, learning various new languages and trying them out by swapping parts of our infrastructure with one written with the new language.
            b EXTRA: "leveling up"
            p "level up"s will be an expensive redeem that multiple people have to redeem to activate. this is done as a way to gauge the sustainability of the broadcast.
            p upon "leveling up", major additions will happen to the stream. this can be a shift in schedule, some new major goal or format, or some kind of special events.
            p in terms of what we did today, we yapped for <b>4 hours</b> and then played a bit of noita. we raided <a href="https://twitch.tv/UWOSLAB">the slab</a> i think
        .card 
            p today's accessory is bnuuy monster stuck onto the creatures head.
            p today the pod experiences EXTREME activity as prod find themselves in a fixation of sorts - we are suddenly thrown off track and begins to create a "song" mode, not too dissimilar to <a href="https://pub.colonq.computer/~prod/toy/dbkai/">various sources</a> from friends of the channels.
            p we review (JOHN react) our way into three different videos, lay out what is needed for the song style and begins actually coding on stream????
            p prod also laments the lack of emote representation and desires this to be rectified immediate. (this is not rectified immediate.)
            p petting also happens here, as well as the invention of the auto petter.
            p in the redeem side of thing, we experience the pit and become consumed by it for a solid hour.
            p we program under duress to create something that is like half working but then realizes the design flaw that doesn't distinguish between chords. we declare DEFEAT and we are lost it all and we are losing and help me to breathe or something of this nature. we went on for 6 hours and we get to see a glimpse of "the limit". 
            p we emergency evacuate onto <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/hexadigital">hexadi</a> lands.
        .card 
            p today's accessory is a western ish hat and glasses.
            p this session marks the beginning of a vicious cycle of "boneless week / bone-in week" that the pod will experience throughout the entirity of the remaining season.
            p after we push ourselves to "the limit", prod experiences a minor case of bonelessness and experiences lament as to their lack of power.
            p asquared's auto petter gets more violent and occasionally duplicates itself now. shit gets weird.
            p we get shocked by it being a fucking month already and does some looking back and whatnot. bottom bar clicking, screen actions as command, <em>!furrowthemareofeidola</em> command was also introduced here, and we introduced more bugs onto the scene.
            p we also get first message notification, raid notification, god i was productive this week very holy
            p but yeah we continue off from last week and actually completes song redeem in a relatively good fashion.
            p we raid <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/dantedaedalusch">dante daedalus mode</a>
        .card 
            p today's accessory is roblox mode ??? idk we didnt have much time for this
            p we introduce two new screen commands: <em>pin</em> and <em>kill</em> to balance the window spams. this however also caused on oversight where a chatter can end a starting soon screen and brb in behalf of the streamer lol.
            p with the introduction of the screen commands the windows doesnt come back for a good while and the screen remains relatively clean.
            p instead we spent our entire budget this week on the funny docket which was like a full on business scrum ??? meeting. we kinda shit on our <a href="lcolonq.computer">progenitor 1</a> saying he got famous and he acts like he dont know nobody and my channels kinda like if modclonk ran a silly computer channel (the last part is kinda true still)
            p we find our sweet spot of "4 hour streaming" and discusses our future plans again (this is going to keep happening until season 1), and discusses any potential wants of the community (10 viewers).
            p we discuss emojis again (this is still not done) and other various elaborations on the future plans of the episode 3 era. following is a keynote of what we discussed so far.

            p this "stream" was done in the <a href="//prod.kr/discord">discord</a> (you should check it out its cool)
            p we went on uneven dream new update tour and was extremely hectic trying to juggle stream blur issue korea friend following the group and all this
            p the reason why the stream was open was bc the last x times tour happened new game was released on <a href="https://ynoproject.net">yno</a> and this time it would be collective unconscious
            p turns out its not btw that did not happen
        .card 
            p todays accessory is a sort of a glitched look, it cycles between all the previous accessories in a random combination from time to time.
            p i rectify and correctly view the clonk situation as beyond any sort of inferior or superiority but rather a state of equal and comradery. with also i discover an interesting extra discovery in the fact that im speedrunning lcolonq broadcast zone. 
            p we try to shift our gears towards the modularity, but then the broadcast is suddenly stopped as we discover how gouche and sick and twisted the original gizmo is structured. prod swears they will create the new and improved rewrite of the Gizmo 2.
            p we upgrade the WASD to FIB - basically just wasd with array [] and dictionary {} support, its suffed as always.
            p we explore the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/mdxcai">medical doctor x(shipping) cai channel</a>

            p the "boneless prod" comes and they are actually dead as hell. like deceased. bro is not thinking.
            p the accessory is literally a greenscreen bc im ready to apologize.
            p gizmo2 has been built only halfway and like none of the shit worked, including screen, chat for half the stream and all the commands.
            p we buzz around for a small amount of time and make <em>!qat</em>, crossword finder integration for the gizmo.
            p we quickly evacuate onto <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/meisaka">woman channel</a>
        .card 
            p the black witchhat and big moon prod is back with a vengeance, and by vengeance i mean the REVAMPED screen. it looks so good now and all the commands are back.
            p the petting also returns and its somehow even more obnoxious.
            p we discuss going to "gay con" and have a random Studio369 encounter.
            p we start sorting icons by rarity and brainstorm some achievement ideas, while discussing future gizmos we can incorporate for the achievements.
            p this is also rare in that we dont program at all in a while. we instead game for a bit.
            p we visit <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/kani_dev">kani developer</a>
        .card 
            p prod is suddenly met with a cruel fate at 1am when their parents crash the living space because of business related emergency, and mic and keyboard priviledges are largely taken.
            p they quickly whip up a tts thing (janky) hexadigital style to emergency communicate, and bird noises are abound throughout the stream.
            p gizmo2 finally goes public, we sorted icons properly, and better font renderer is FINALLY in its early stages of development despite being talked about since episode 1. yeah.
            p but yeah we bring friends of the stream nichePenguin and ctrl_o computers into <a href="https://yume.wiki/2kki/Planetarium">Planetarium</a> and <a href="https://yume.wiki/2kki/Depths">Depths</a> zone in the world of <a href="https://ynoproject.net/2kki/">2kki</a>ing. CU hype!
            p we slip into the realms of the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/conditionbleen">crt man</a>
        .card
            p prod is Green is Good Mode and becomes zenith once more. they try to reference something in the lore but gets lost and becomes john mandela.
            p they showcase the docket in a new format: drawing worlds in those dream games. we discuss the "Two-Week Cycle" phenomenon they discovered where their energy state is in a state of consistent flux.
            p they also catch up to the progenitor by becoming bon vivant today, and discusses how they are so back now. we showcase kalimba, we showcase new blog, and we discuss how programmingtime need to be sillier.
            p regardless, todays stream is artstream where we draw the default shimeji for Ascension purposes.
            p in the middle we gets bombarded by 13 thousand windows and lag out the computer, art under duress has been achieved.
            p we adjoin the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/het_tanis">the president of linux</a>
        .card
            p we start off with the intro offset with the graphic bc lag (LOL bruh), todays prod has blocks stuck onto it and generally unstable.
            p and then we show off the NEW format in docket: one embedded within the gizmomode. 
            p today's theming is Ooze, the slime, and we reflect on this with :susdie: as we interpret these messages as a form of fluidity, where they finally realize that maybe they shouldnt stress about being funny or silly or entertaining bc theyre not growing their channel anyways and the content doesnt matter as much as banter.
            p they vow to never overwork themselves again as they immediately announce a overhaul to the cs zone. 
            p we then create the shimejis, going Ascension mode, this resolves quicker than we expect and we add web functionality so you can spawn and move them too.
            p then the ending gets triggered prematurely and we are sucked into the ending screen where a new season is revealed, with 2 sessions per week and some improvements to come. 
            p we hastily vacate onto the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/jddoesdev">jd channel</a>, and later that day clonk reveals his theme of Ooze as well. we have stepped into the future.
        .card
            p prod is ooze mode (PHYSICAL instead of mental) not because its an intended aesthetic, but like bc the colors broke LOL oh my god
            p prod returns in below minimum viable product mode, no starting soon or brb screen, physics is very bad ("quicksand" occurs), chat window goes above the zone and covers the creature, everything is wilding.
            p prod spends 2 week out of their 3ish week break making the elaborate new textmode, and all the functionality of the new v2 textmode is revealed (its awesome).
            p we do a lot of returnation related chatting, i showcase the new raylib gizmo and tell the tall tale of how we got there, and we overcome this immense duress by coding back some miscellaneous commands like remove triangle, gravity and idol dream.
            p we tease the next time zone by playing a bit of tetris (HUGE mistake LOL) and raid <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/hazmatvt">just about to raid out as well zone</a>.
        .card
            p prod is back into the land of un-oozed, song is back and the quicksand is mostly fixed as well. we encounter a problem where starting soon screen is not closable due to "issues".
            p we then talk about how it is Freaking Monday ??? this is the first time streaming in monday and its actually kinda wild that it is so soon that we meet again.
            p we do the ascension again where i create the shimeji things back into reality. unfortunately?? we do the job too early that even after doing the extra quest of putting the user labels in were done, and we weren't going to play freaking tetris again so were raiding <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/setolyx">seto zone</a>.
        .card
            p prod is mixing and matching season 0 equipments until new season begins proper, and this time its the teal items and white dress.
            p we talk about the tall tale of prod in Tetris Hell and how they survived the ordeal, and reflects upon the gamerization of last time, vowing to never have such a problem again (they do).
            p they come up with THREE (3) objectives, restoring capital, restoring bottom bar and restoring the BATTLE that is the z-fighting.
            p we struggle a little bit on the bottom bar as we fail to nail down the positions and we find a bug in the nine-slice mechanisms but we blaze through the rest of it, leaving another hour to fill yet again. prod is absolutely not playing tetris again, so we raid <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/karichary">the shrimp lands</a>.
        .card
            p prod is proper dark mode today as we prepare the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2840590/no_signal/">no signal</a> zone.
            p prod talks about how they went to touch grass with the girls and now they have no time to get the gizmo working in half a week (and therefore no emotes :( ) in like 40 minutes lol.
            p we play the point and click narrative type game by <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/exodrifter_">exo guy</a>, and gives it like a playtesting thing.
            p we 100% the demo and send the reviews over. however during the tail end the ram situation exceeds the given quota and the stream lags into the hell zone, making the game unseeable AND the stream a minute into the future. this issue persists as prod from this point forward acknowledges the chat a minute late constant.
            p we then had some time over so we go and play the <a href="https://twitch.tv/yiffweed">yiff video game</a> (rogue style). this is the game they working on on stream as well. we play until floor 4 ish and then prod figures out the game is 13 whole floors long. this will be a staple of the FREAKING monday sesh.
            p prod briefly considers raiding a new guy and then feels raiding not exo applying my own god damn feedback feels improper.

            p prod did get like 70th on realgame and 21st on the first postgame with minimal screen distraction in the end
            p we were going to raid the organizer but we couldnt raid due to affiliate zone, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/BixiaVT">so we raided our friend</a> on the other other

            p the time is finally NOW to tackle the Big Goal A1 - the beginning of the Guy Saga, where we make the guys actually move and act on their own
            p we create various statistics and tied them to chatter behaviour. each statistics are between 0%(exclusive) and 100%(inclusive).
            ul
                li: p <em>Dexterity</em>: How often does the guy move, determined by percentage of time chatting vs lurking
                li: p <em>Jokerness</em>: Variance of the delay between movements, determined by amount of ":3" in chat messages
                li: p <em>Agility</em>: How far do does the guy move per 1 movement, determined by average length of chat messages
                li: p <em>Jumpness</em>: How often does the guy chooses to jump instead of move, determined by amount of punctuations in chat messages

                li: p <em>Appleness</em>, <em>Banananess</em> and <em>Orangeness</em>: reserved for now
            p we also spent some time speedrunning the bible episode in an hour and discovered a critical javascript flaw leading to complete shutdowns.
            p we get the movement part without wisdom done and now the Guys move, opening a New Chapter in prod Zed pod broadcast
            p raid <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/enlynn_">no WAY we havent raided you yet</a>

            p two new Special Guys join the fray, being LCOLONQ's Green and bigbookofbug's big bug
            p despite our numerous goals we actually finish it in like 2 hours and decides to continue our Playing Friend's Videogame series by visiting asquared's emacs game
            p we interface with Default Keybinding Emacs (scary) and play the rule discovery thing (it was neat) and talk about potential improvement for post-jam versions
            p at the end we also get another Special Guy from YukieVT (large, long even)
            p we then see <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/sphaerophoria">gpu FINALE</a>

            p today we cut the crap and go straight into our objective of making Projectile Warfare - finally using the rest of our stats
            p we also add !stat command to see stats, add it to the screen, and get average in each stat so you can see true deviations
            p overall a very solid episode, very productive stream this one

            p prod is charger blocks?? the "ear plugs" are new accessory
            p the blocks werent visible because the outlines werent showing so we quickly fix this up in blender before real stream begin
            p after prod sets up a Blue Sky account they feel a need to make a "type !post on discord and it posts to every social media" command, so we are dealing with Four Oauths at once
            p before that prod laments the fact that some apis (like itch or kofi) has api but not api for posting blogs and only concerned with sales and donations
            p Stage 1: blue sky goes extremely well since it wasnt even an oauth we just put in id and password and it worked
            p Stage 2: mastodon worked so much better than expected since you were able to generate oauth keys on site and it doesnt expire, leading to easy access and no code flow necessary
            p Stage 3: tumblr gave us a little trouble as we actually had to do oauth stuff but in the end we got it, it was marginally harder than twitch zone due to lack of validate token endpoint
            p Stage 4: twitter was actual hell we kind of mind broke at the end idk what happened in this segment ngl but we kind of got it to work
            p the systems arent usable yet bc we have to hook it up to main zone and all this but the hard part is done, this will be used in a couple weeks
            p r <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/fwofie">new model debut?!</a>

            p prod is purple umbrella real style today
            p today prod straight up copies the MALE's "twitch front page" title to do a "hand cam" analysis
            p prod talks about progress in the gameZONE and ufo 50 and talks about the need to have hand move
            p we then discuss the sheer pain making a whole inverse kinematics thing from NIH hell would take and decide to take a shortcut by canonically removing wrists from the creature
            p then this becomes a hardest session yet as we go for almost 6 hour in a pure programming focused no bs yap moment (insane)
            p at the end we are horrified to discover that our rotation system was fucked to begin with, making our life oh so miserable. prod vows to get that quaternion down at some point
            p we get raided like 3 times in the end so the end part gets elongated, prod uses time to talk about the new witcord activity that is occuring post-no nyt november
            p we raid <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/omochii_ch">the last of the collab crew for this one</a>
        .card
            p yeah remember the "new witcord activity" were making a autosolver for it today
            p prod is sprouted up yet extremely eepy as prod has not slept due to risk of rain complications
            p this was originally going to be a gamedev episode but the big eep blocked prods brain with so much fog that we had to pivot to something lighter, and this was good
            p woggle is a hybrid between the witness (2016) and boggle, where there are 4x4 grid with letters and you draw a line between those letters from the lower left corner to the upper right while forming regions that anagrams to a valid word
            p points were calculated by +number of letters points per valid region over 3 letters, and +1 bonus point for 6 or higher lettered region with a maximum of 18
            p we pregenerated the grid paths and downloaded a wordlist and sorted each word alphabetically beforehand, and then implemented a simple thing to check for each path for valid words
            p there became a sort of competition zone where multiple people decided to suddenly work on their own version of the woggle solver with asquared and xorxavier doing their own things
            p thus JOI (jerson of interest) was born. we also observe sus1d1p after were done
            p prod then encounteres a HORRIEble situation where all the people alive rn we have raided in the recent times and strictly them, making the selection incredibly difficult
            p we end up gathering immense amount of courage to <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/MikansBox">raid a "stranger" ("gasp") MALE has recommended to us</a>

            p in terms of the meat we finally make the little guys fight and put the rest of the stats to good use
            p we then discover a little tactic where we move away from enemy to regen when we're losing and chase enemy when we're winning via moveguy command
            p we then enable this further by adding <em>!jump</em> command
            p raid <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/ghorr">woah its the freaky hands guy</a>

            p we also play the demo for crazykitty's new gambling game roguelike
            p we then also showcase the hacknet mod that im making and by proxy the game hacknet in general for the docket
            p and then we realize weve been yapping for like 2 and a half hours and we finally lock in, today were making flips and cameras real
            p prod suddenly loses ALL bone 3 hours in and barely manages to finish out the flips part as well as the camera part from earlier

            p today we finish the social posting era as we implement image and video posting
            p as expected we spend 10 minutes on doing bluesky and mastodon and spend the other 4 hours doing tumblr and twitter which end up not working anyways because the oauth keeps resetting without a refresh token (bad websites ngl)
            p due to the variety of file types and the "ffprobe" zone we end up using a library (gasp !) and we end up making it work for all except twitter which we assume it works ??? we couldnt test bc rate limits
            p <a href="https://twitch.tv/TheIdOfAlan">we expand our horizon of raid</a> once again btw we have new set of ppl to raid now

            p we then do a lot of various screen deals, fixing palette reset, getting various parts of lore and achievements up to date, and fixing raid bosses
            p because we debugged raid bosses today 3 whole people gained the pillar when normally its 1 per stream
            p we also see the appearance of 3 new custom Guys in the area

            p there was a ton of guys and we had a whole plan of world dominations and stuff so we started an hour early for War Room session where we talk about getting villagers in an hour and making 15 farms and getting infinite end crystals
            p yeah turns out signature Jake Scuff happens and we are dropped in the most barren minecraft world known to man where getting a single apple is impossible and brown mushroom is a rare commodity
            p we quickly mine full diamond in an hour and then emergency evacuate onto echorin 2kki tour epic style (second video, blog entry)
            p we strike a deal with badcop (explorer of dangerous fields) for 2 cured villagers in the wild, explore the bastion with dii, and actually get close to making the villager breeder work actual except SERVER DRAMA ?? happens and we were set back and our dreams were seemingly crushed
            p however while mining for more diamonds we stumble upon a secret mineshaft and another chance in forms of dungeon chest is handed to our souls
            p to prevent future disasters we move our base to SKYFORT LCOLONQ and then make farms in preparations determined to at least get the villager thing working until the server closes
            p eventually the governing party (jake and badcop mostly) realizes how horrible the seed is and scuff their way into expanded borders, actually including villagers and strongholds this time and also making our shit kind of obsolete now
            p regardless, we manage to stay completely within the original border and get the thing finally working (we get 2 villagers at the end of stream)
            p we then do dragon fight and other outro related stuff (we were left behind in the outro so we arent in the final picture)

            p during minecraft talk the theory behind "prod craft" has been expanded, where it would be a "all cheats allowed" kind of server where people "build robots" and "program for fun" - but also it has "ic2" and its "somewhere between alpha 1.0 and release 1.7.2 lol"
            p we also talk about "meteor", and get to know one of the new Off-Screen guy appearance by maradyne. all that after we finally start getting into the Real Deal of "the incident"
            p in the pre-stream time, ctrl_o's entire user data blew up and disappeared into thin air - leaving us with "absolutely nothing", to combat this we devised a plan to "not do this": every end of stream now user data is backed up to some "cloud" where it is secure, and to aid this we added a !takeout command that allows you to download your own data (gdpr compliant??)
            p and then asquared reads prod's data and uses the screen vulnerability of Using ID As Token to gain access to the entire system (and the entire pc by extension) and starts messing with things, spawning windows and shouting out various people
            p we make logging better and then also vows to install some security measures for next time (we do)
