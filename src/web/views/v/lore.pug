    h1 The Lore 
    p Welcome to <em>the pod</em>, see the <a href="https://prod.kr/v">v page</a> for the setting and introduction of myself but we do go live every <em class='time'>Thursday 20:00 GMT</em> and <em class='time'>Monday 20:00 GMT</em>.
    p we give way too much control to the viewers, talk in an unapologetically insane manner and <u><s>barely</s> somewhat program</u>.
    h2 The Gizmo
    p one of the main feature of the broadcast is the high-effort homemade gizmo (the Monstrous Project) we have going on. the source of this project is available under <a href="https://github.com/prodzpod/stream">github</a>.
    h3 The Chat
    p since the beginning of Season 1, various bbcode-like syntax can be used to markup your text.
    p basic syntax is <em>&lt;item key=value key2=value2&gt;text&lt;/&gt;</em>. notice the lack of label on the closing tag. tags that do not require a closing tag is labeled "self-closing". all key-values are optional and can be omitted. default value is shown for this documentation.
    ul
        li: p <em>&lt;reset&gt;</em>: resets any text modification.
        li: p <em>&lt;br&gt;</em>: (self-closing) adds a newline (useful in twitch).
        li: p <em>&lt;b&gt;</em>: makes the text bold (only supported by corresponding fonts).

            h3 Game Dev
            p we are currently on an arc to complete <a href="https://prodzpod.itch.io/startellers">Startellers</a>, my videogame project that needs to be completed til like this year at the very least. we do that on mondays often.

            h3 Twitch Chat is actually IRCv3 
            p this also means we have <em>IRC to IRC communication</em> kind of (right now stream chat doesnt get picked up by clonk irc, but the other way works and discord gets picked up by both).
        .card
            h3 specs
            ul 
                li basic structure is something like <em>[instrument][global modifier][notes]</em> separated by the <em>|</em> (vertical bar) character.
                li currently available instruments are <em>sine</em>, <em>tri</em>, <em>sq50</em> and <em>drum</em>. when instruments are not provided (such as the original bells text), it defaults to <em>sine</em>.
                li global modifiers apply to every notes in this track. by default, C is C4, and BPM is 75.
                li: ul 
                    li octave control: <em>'</em> increases default octave by 2, <em>,</em> decreases by 2 and <em>"</em> increases by 1. this can be combined like <em>",</em> to -1 octave.
                    li bpm control: <em>;</em> to double bpm, <em>:</em> to triple, <em>-</em> to half bpm, <em>=</em> to third. manually typing numbers bells style works as well.
                    li microtones support: <em>%</em> followed by number to set equal temperment that starts on C. for example, <em>%31</em> (31EDO) would make <em>C~F6#</em> a single octave.
                    li <em>&amp;</em> copies the previous track's global modifiers. useful for multi tracks with same bpm.
                    li <em>.</em> is a blank modifier, and is used to separate instrument from notes. when instrument name is blank, the song gets saved as the "notes" as a title. the song such as <em>.title|sine.[notes...]</em> can be later used like <em>!song title</em> as a shorthand.
                li notes are composed of the tone and modifiers. <em>[</em> character creates a group of tones that plays at the same time and all gets the same modifier. for example, <em>[CEG=</em> plays a 3 beat long C major chord.
                    li available notes are <em>C D E F G A B</em>, black keys can be expressed by <em>C# D# F# G# A#</em> or alternatively <em>X S R T Q</em> as shorthand. rests are expressed as <em>/</em>.
                    li lowercase letters are uppercase letters +1 octaves.
                    li there's also <em>J K L M N H I</em> as C3~B3, <em>Y U O P W</em> as C#3~A#3, <em>j k l m n h i</em> as C6~B6 and <em>y u o p w</em> as C#6~A#6. 
                    li octave control from global modifier also works here, but also bells-style number notation works (<em>C#2</em> is the same as <em>X,</em>)
                    li beats control from global modifier works as well, with <em>;:</em> shortening the beats and <em>-=</em> lengthening it. <em>C;=</em> would be 1.5 beats, and 0.3 seconds on 75 BPM (default).
                    li beats can also be added or deleted arithmetically by <em>+</em>, <em>~</em> (addition) or <em>_</em> (subtraction). where every term begins with 1 beat. <em>C++</em> becomes "C for 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 beats", <em>C=+_:-</em> becomes "C for 3 + 1 - 2/3 = 10/3 beats".
                    li much like octaves, beats can be specified by <em>@</em> followed by a number. like <em>C#@5.5</em>.
                    li <em>&lt;</em> and <em>&gt;</em> drops the attack and release of each note respectively, allowing for slide type action.
                    li <em>!</em> is a special modifier in that the note doesn't "advance the staff line", allowing for notes to overlap with different note lengths and whatnot without multi tracks. see the blank arpeggio (<em>W@12!/C@11!/S@10!/Q@9 P@12!/C@11!/S@10!/T@9</em>) as an example.
                    li <em>?</em> is a special note (NOT a modifier) that takes in global modifier as a modifier. this changes the global modifier mid staff, allowing for bpm shifts and such.
                    li <em>]</em> stops modifiers (exists for bells compat).
        .card 
            p since prod is korea, Twitch Korea doesnt save VODs despite the setting being on and therefore it is gone. i will recap as detailed as possible to compensate.
            p after 1(+5/7) week of unhealthy gamer development, prod finally goes live for the first* time. and then everything goes to shit after.
            p chat stops working after the 10th message, everyone shows up as "prodzpod" (this is technically lore accurate maybe), prod haven't finished making the 3d model thing so its just a png (that doesnt move, worse than a pngtuber), everythings messed up.
            img(src="https://prod.kr/images/lore/0-1.png")
            p most of the discussions remains as part of the twitch-discord bridge that thankfully mostly worked.
            p prod complains about how they "planned everything and its all fucked up", then tries to showcase the gizmo, and then the stream dies upon !login. they boot it back up only for it to go off again when someone else tries logging in.
            p they fix like 1 minor issue and then the voice gives in because they were singing vocaloid songs while coding that entire week. they get sleeby and end stream like 90 minutes in. we raided <a href="https://twitch.tv/tyumici">tyumici</a>.
        .card
            p the debut stream happened. the model style appears, the gizmo is shown off, and some introduction happens.
            p we also discover the modal of "z-fighting", which probably will be a core part of the broadcast.
            p plenty of errors happen, and the creature gets sent to various inaccessible locations frequently. also the window title is broken. lol.
            p we raid <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/exodrifter_">exodrifter_</a> after talking about how i was tired when i first joined her stream and was kinda annoying lol
        .card 
            p today's accessory is a hastily put together "mushroom witch hat". the concept of a weekly accessory is brought up. the powerpoint docket becomes a regular thing after the positive reception from the first stream. 
            p pose system is shown off as well. the "cyberspace graph mode" is shown off, describing each corners of the gayness scale and softwareline meter.
            img(src="https://prod.kr/images/lore/2-1.png")
            p we also create the first ever general redeem: <button>!removetriangle [number]</button>, that removes a random number of triangles from the creature. creature becomes shambles quickly.
            p the websocket zone was bugged to hell though, spamming "what???" (also known as inaccessible code mode).
            p we talk about the progenitors, john react to the -1st session of prodzpod v scenario (the serendipidous collab) within <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/imgeiser">imgeiser</a>, and raid <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/digi_shell">digi_shell</a> with lcolonq in the chat, completing the trifecta.
        .card 
            p today's accessory is a halo thing, its got stars in it, brb screen was introduced here, as well as proper window tracking by obs (this is the thing in the episode 1 video)
            p we lay out our Grand Plan - the temporal list. the eternal formula to HAPPINESS, some may say. the details of this list is still changing and growing with the input of all of you, so please comment if you have a sick idea or feel like some priority shifting is needed.
            b SEASON 0: testing in prod 
            p we set up the infrastructure necessary to move forward: economy, emotes, achievements, and font renderer is in order.
            b SEASON 1: "z-fighting era"
            p we will be making chatters into customizable "desktop buddies" that can fight each other and roam around the screen.
            p we will also make prod desktop buddy into a real executable you can all utilize in your personal computer.
            p we will also try to move away from javascript, learning various new languages and trying them out by swapping parts of our infrastructure with one written with the new language.
            b EXTRA: "leveling up"
            p "level up"s will be an expensive redeem that multiple people have to redeem to activate. this is done as a way to gauge the sustainability of the broadcast.
            p upon "leveling up", major additions will happen to the stream. this can be a shift in schedule, some new major goal or format, or some kind of special events.
            p in terms of what we did today, we yapped for <b>4 hours</b> and then played a bit of noita. we raided <a href="https://twitch.tv/UWOSLAB">the slab</a> i think
        .card 
            p today's accessory is bnuuy monster stuck onto the creatures head.
            p today the pod experiences EXTREME activity as prod find themselves in a fixation of sorts - we are suddenly thrown off track and begins to create a "song" mode, not too dissimilar to <a href="https://pub.colonq.computer/~prod/toy/dbkai/">various sources</a> from friends of the channels.
            p we review (JOHN react) our way into three different videos, lay out what is needed for the song style and begins actually coding on stream????
            p prod also laments the lack of emote representation and desires this to be rectified immediate. (this is not rectified immediate.)
            p petting also happens here, as well as the invention of the auto petter.
            p in the redeem side of thing, we experience the pit and become consumed by it for a solid hour.
            p we program under duress to create something that is like half working but then realizes the design flaw that doesn't distinguish between chords. we declare DEFEAT and we are lost it all and we are losing and help me to breathe or something of this nature. we went on for 6 hours and we get to see a glimpse of "the limit". 
            p we emergency evacuate onto <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/hexadigital">hexadi</a> lands.
        .card 
            p today's accessory is a western ish hat and glasses.
            p this session marks the beginning of a vicious cycle of "boneless week / bone-in week" that the pod will experience throughout the entirity of the remaining season.
            p after we push ourselves to "the limit", prod experiences a minor case of bonelessness and experiences lament as to their lack of power.
            p asquared's auto petter gets more violent and occasionally duplicates itself now. shit gets weird.
            p we get shocked by it being a fucking month already and does some looking back and whatnot. bottom bar clicking, screen actions as command, <em>!furrowthemareofeidola</em> command was also introduced here, and we introduced more bugs onto the scene.
            p we also get first message notification, raid notification, god i was productive this week very holy
            p but yeah we continue off from last week and actually completes song redeem in a relatively good fashion.
            p we raid <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/dantedaedalusch">dante daedalus mode</a>
        .card 
            p today's accessory is roblox mode ??? idk we didnt have much time for this
            p we introduce two new screen commands: <em>pin</em> and <em>kill</em> to balance the window spams. this however also caused on oversight where a chatter can end a starting soon screen and brb in behalf of the streamer lol.
            p with the introduction of the screen commands the windows doesnt come back for a good while and the screen remains relatively clean.
            p instead we spent our entire budget this week on the funny docket which was like a full on business scrum ??? meeting. we kinda shit on our <a href="lcolonq.computer">progenitor 1</a> saying he got famous and he acts like he dont know nobody and my channels kinda like if modclonk ran a silly computer channel (the last part is kinda true still)
            p we find our sweet spot of "4 hour streaming" and discusses our future plans again (this is going to keep happening until season 1), and discusses any potential wants of the community (10 viewers).
            p we discuss emojis again (this is still not done) and other various elaborations on the future plans of the episode 3 era. following is a keynote of what we discussed so far.

                        li they can spawn them into the screen via a redeem and make them fight each other

                        li but also theres a skill element by retreating at the right moment and a kind of chicken game aspect (its a lot like runescape pvp)
                        li these will also be used in various minigames outside of fighting (such as chatter racing, where they will throw previous chat messages at each other to slow each other down)

            p we raid <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/keitaroch">keitaro channel (ch)</a>
        .card
            p this "stream" was done in the <a href="//prod.kr/discord">discord</a> (you should check it out its cool)
            p we went on uneven dream new update tour and was extremely hectic trying to juggle stream blur issue korea friend following the group and all this
            p the reason why the stream was open was bc the last x times tour happened new game was released on <a href="https://ynoproject.net">yno</a> and this time it would be collective unconscious
            p turns out its not btw that did not happen
        .card 
            p todays accessory is a sort of a glitched look, it cycles between all the previous accessories in a random combination from time to time.
            p i rectify and correctly view the clonk situation as beyond any sort of inferior or superiority but rather a state of equal and comradery. with also i discover an interesting extra discovery in the fact that im speedrunning lcolonq broadcast zone. 
            p we try to shift our gears towards the modularity, but then the broadcast is suddenly stopped as we discover how gouche and sick and twisted the original gizmo is structured. prod swears they will create the new and improved rewrite of the Gizmo 2.
            p we upgrade the WASD to FIB - basically just wasd with array [] and dictionary {} support, its suffed as always.
            p we explore the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/mdxcai">medical doctor x(shipping) cai channel</a>
        .card 
            p the "boneless prod" comes and they are actually dead as hell. like deceased. bro is not thinking.
            p the accessory is literally a greenscreen bc im ready to apologize.
            p gizmo2 has been built only halfway and like none of the shit worked, including screen, chat for half the stream and all the commands.
            p we buzz around for a small amount of time and make <em>!qat</em>, crossword finder integration for the gizmo.
            p we quickly evacuate onto <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/meisaka">woman channel</a>
        .card 
            p the black witchhat and big moon prod is back with a vengeance, and by vengeance i mean the REVAMPED screen. it looks so good now and all the commands are back.
            p the petting also returns and its somehow even more obnoxious.
            p we discuss going to "gay con" and have a random Studio369 encounter.
            p we start sorting icons by rarity and brainstorm some achievement ideas, while discussing future gizmos we can incorporate for the achievements.
            p this is also rare in that we dont program at all in a while. we instead game for a bit.
            p we visit <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/kani_dev">kani developer</a>
        .card 
            p prod is suddenly met with a cruel fate at 1am when their parents crash the living space because of business related emergency, and mic and keyboard priviledges are largely taken.
            p they quickly whip up a tts thing (janky) hexadigital style to emergency communicate, and bird noises are abound throughout the stream.
            p gizmo2 finally goes public, we sorted icons properly, and better font renderer is FINALLY in its early stages of development despite being talked about since episode 1. yeah.
            p but yeah we bring friends of the stream nichePenguin and ctrl_o computers into <a href="https://yume.wiki/2kki/Planetarium">Planetarium</a> and <a href="https://yume.wiki/2kki/Depths">Depths</a> zone in the world of <a href="https://ynoproject.net/2kki/">2kki</a>ing. CU hype!
            p we slip into the realms of the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/conditionbleen">crt man</a>
        .card
            p prod is Green is Good Mode and becomes zenith once more. they try to reference something in the lore but gets lost and becomes john mandela.
            p they showcase the docket in a new format: drawing worlds in those dream games. we discuss the "Two-Week Cycle" phenomenon they discovered where their energy state is in a state of consistent flux.
            p they also catch up to the progenitor by becoming bon vivant today, and discusses how they are so back now. we showcase kalimba, we showcase new blog, and we discuss how programmingtime need to be sillier.
            p regardless, todays stream is artstream where we draw the default shimeji for Ascension purposes.
            p in the middle we gets bombarded by 13 thousand windows and lag out the computer, art under duress has been achieved.
            p we adjoin the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/het_tanis">the president of linux</a>
        .card
            p we start off with the intro offset with the graphic bc lag (LOL bruh), todays prod has blocks stuck onto it and generally unstable.
            p and then we show off the NEW format in docket: one embedded within the gizmomode. 
            p today's theming is Ooze, the slime, and we reflect on this with :susdie: as we interpret these messages as a form of fluidity, where they finally realize that maybe they shouldnt stress about being funny or silly or entertaining bc theyre not growing their channel anyways and the content doesnt matter as much as banter.
            p they vow to never overwork themselves again as they immediately announce a overhaul to the cs zone. 
            p we then create the shimejis, going Ascension mode, this resolves quicker than we expect and we add web functionality so you can spawn and move them too.
            p then the ending gets triggered prematurely and we are sucked into the ending screen where a new season is revealed, with 2 sessions per week and some improvements to come. 
            p we hastily vacate onto the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/jddoesdev">jd channel</a>, and later that day clonk reveals his theme of Ooze as well. we have stepped into the future.
        .card
            p prod is ooze mode (PHYSICAL instead of mental) not because its an intended aesthetic, but like bc the colors broke LOL oh my god
            p prod returns in below minimum viable product mode, no starting soon or brb screen, physics is very bad ("quicksand" occurs), chat window goes above the zone and covers the creature, everything is wilding.
            p prod spends 2 week out of their 3ish week break making the elaborate new textmode, and all the functionality of the new v2 textmode is revealed (its awesome).
            p we do a lot of returnation related chatting, i showcase the new raylib gizmo and tell the tall tale of how we got there, and we overcome this immense duress by coding back some miscellaneous commands like remove triangle, gravity and idol dream.
            p we tease the next time zone by playing a bit of tetris (HUGE mistake LOL) and raid <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/hazmatvt">just about to raid out as well zone</a>.
        .card
            p prod is back into the land of un-oozed, song is back and the quicksand is mostly fixed as well. we encounter a problem where starting soon screen is not closable due to "issues".
            p we then talk about how it is Freaking Monday ??? this is the first time streaming in monday and its actually kinda wild that it is so soon that we meet again.
            p we do the ascension again where i create the shimeji things back into reality. unfortunately?? we do the job too early that even after doing the extra quest of putting the user labels in were done, and we weren't going to play freaking tetris again so were raiding <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/setolyx">seto zone</a>.
        .card
            p prod is mixing and matching season 0 equipments until new season begins proper, and this time its the teal items and white dress.
            p we talk about the tall tale of prod in Tetris Hell and how they survived the ordeal, and reflects upon the gamerization of last time, vowing to never have such a problem again (they do).
            p they come up with THREE (3) objectives, restoring capital, restoring bottom bar and restoring the BATTLE that is the z-fighting.
            p we struggle a little bit on the bottom bar as we fail to nail down the positions and we find a bug in the nine-slice mechanisms but we blaze through the rest of it, leaving another hour to fill yet again. prod is absolutely not playing tetris again, so we raid <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/karichary">the shrimp lands</a>.
        .card
            p prod is proper dark mode today as we prepare the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2840590/no_signal/">no signal</a> zone.
            p prod talks about how they went to touch grass with the girls and now they have no time to get the gizmo working in half a week (and therefore no emotes :( ) in like 40 minutes lol.
            p we play the point and click narrative type game by <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/exodrifter_">exo guy</a>, and gives it like a playtesting thing.
            p we 100% the demo and send the reviews over. however during the tail end the ram situation exceeds the given quota and the stream lags into the hell zone, making the game unseeable AND the stream a minute into the future. this issue persists as prod from this point forward acknowledges the chat a minute late constant.
            p we then had some time over so we go and play the <a href="https://twitch.tv/yiffweed">yiff video game</a> (rogue style). this is the game they working on on stream as well. we play until floor 4 ish and then prod figures out the game is 13 whole floors long. this will be a staple of the FREAKING monday sesh.
            p prod briefly considers raiding a new guy and then feels raiding not exo applying my own god damn feedback feels improper.

            p Stage 1: blue sky goes extremely well since it wasnt even an oauth we just put in id and password and it worked
            p Stage 2: mastodon worked so much better than expected since you were able to generate oauth keys on site and it doesnt expire, leading to easy access and no code flow necessary

            p we pregenerated the grid paths and downloaded a wordlist and sorted each word alphabetically beforehand, and then implemented a simple thing to check for each path for valid words
            p there became a sort of competition zone where multiple people decided to suddenly work on their own version of the woggle solver with asquared and xorxavier doing their own things
            p thus JOI (jerson of interest) was born. we also observe sus1d1p after were done
            p prod then encounteres a HORRIEble situation where all the people alive rn we have raided in the recent times and strictly them, making the selection incredibly difficult
            p we end up gathering immense amount of courage to <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/MikansBox">raid a "stranger" ("gasp") MALE has recommended to us</a>
        .card
            p prod is bandana today ready for battle because today is Obyn Greenfoot Wednesday (it is not wednesday) and we are here for strife

            p our good friends nichepenguin and control join again and also new friends <a href="https://twitch.tv/mickynoon">michael noon</a> and party cat lol
            p we get bike first and then SR shortcut, we then struggle hard style on the Chaser Area as we lose two of our bravest soldiers to the Women
            p we eventually get to foliage estate but suddenly <a href="https://twitch.tv/LCOLONQ">LCOLONQ STREAM</a> START and we have to rush like so hard
            p we ended up getting to satellite and call it there

            p before the docket we were greeted by clips of the salad forrest zone during interview with the male where i was mentioned thanks to our good friend archible
            p todays docket is INSIDE risk of rain ??? game ??? its like a mod type situation and its docket
            p we then suddenly divulge into gcp lore and add Polish Temperature into our gcp calculation as well as venorrak's JCP (thank you krzysckh for Polish Temperature)
            p we also play the demo for crazykitty's new gambling game roguelike

            p and then we realize weve been yapping for like 2 and a half hours and we finally lock in, today were making flips and cameras real

            p prod goes "live" on the <a href="//prod.kr/discord">discord</a> again they were improving gizmo stuff and though why not do this live
            p we first fix various buge such as website time thing
            p then we go into portfolio zone and make the tags autogenerate as well as adding a featured tag and a enable/disable all button
            p while doing so we go into various tangents such as the viability of whisper mode, the origins of middle ear, stealing every vtuber's "the emote" and compiling them into one, and most importantly the fish drawer
            p we vow to create some kind of fish collection system where they are like an item for guy fights maybe?? well see

            p we have transcended reflection squares as we have to go into whole time rectangles with hourly time allocations, they were extremely busy this entire week (and a few more after)
            p prod also showcases a bit of irl fit type scenario where they are kind of like same as the guy but brown hair and glasses
            p today we finish the social posting era as we implement image and video posting
            p as expected we spend 10 minutes on doing bluesky and mastodon and spend the other 4 hours doing tumblr and twitter which end up not working anyways because the oauth keeps resetting without a refresh token (bad websites ngl)
            p due to the variety of file types and the "ffprobe" zone we end up using a library (gasp !) and we end up making it work for all except twitter which we assume it works ??? we couldnt test bc rate limits
            p <a href="https://twitch.tv/TheIdOfAlan">we expand our horizon of raid</a> once again btw we have new set of ppl to raid now

            p prod is blue party hat runescape for 3 trillion rs3 gold (about 0.02 cents)
            p we finally make fighting real by adding five things:
            ul
                li: p whenever a guy is victorious, a guy now gains "stat point" one can use with "level up" to "gain temporary stats" in "the gizmo"
                li: p 2v1 (overpowered) now requires "coordination"
                li: p "john lennon" is now only possible by the currently winning party
                li: p one can engage in "ranged combat" by throwing objects such as windows or chat messages
                li: p "raid bosses" are now introduced with a respective achievement
            p we also visit "<a href="https://twitch.tv/mickynoon">mickynoon</a> debut" (huge) and talk about how freaking cool <a href="https://twitch.tv/mickynoon">mickynoon stream</a> is

            p we get into a large number of !fight immediately
            p the audio is greatly improved now ?! no more noise style but we tried our best to also capture the keyboard type noises and we demonstrate while also doing new seasonal tetr gamemode
            p we also talk about the ANSWER to the question from !girlfriend and the upcoming jakezone
            p we then do a lot of various screen deals, fixing palette reset, getting various parts of lore and achievements up to date, and fixing raid bosses
            p because we debugged raid bosses today 3 whole people gained the pillar when normally its 1 per stream
            p we also see the appearance of 3 new custom Guys in the area
            p there was a <a href="https://twitch.tv/digi_shell">digi</a> raid btw that was cool we were on the zone of all progenitor in 1 stream
            p <a href="https://twitch.tv/AznUsagi">raid</a>

            p we also talk about teeth teeth is cool
            p and then we discover that raid boss is broken ????? so we do a lot of raid boss fixing instead of making games btw
            p eventually we do indeed make timer and badge savestate for Free Mode purposes
            p there was a <a href="https://twitch.tv/sphaerophoria">sphaero</a> raid and it was kind of too insane so we do a little more gamething and then we kind of evacuate lol
            p <a href="https://twitch.tv/Nicchiketto">raid and consequently extra 2kki tour</a> happens
        .card
            p we participate in <a href="https://twitch.tv/JakeCreatesStuff">jake</a>'s charity FOR THE KIDS !!!!!!!! gamers outreach jolly jamboree thing minecraft server <a href="https://twitch.tv/badcop_">badcop</a> special style
            p there was a ton of guys and we had a whole plan of world dominations and stuff so we started an hour early for War Room session where we talk about getting villagers in an hour and making 15 farms and getting infinite end crystals
            p yeah turns out signature <a href="https://twitch.tv/JakeCreatesStuff">Jake Scuff</a> happens and we are dropped in the most barren minecraft world known to man where getting a single apple is impossible and brown mushroom is a rare commodity
            p we quickly mine full diamond in an hour and then emergency evacuate onto <a href="https://twitch.tv/EchorinP">echorin 2kki</a> tour epic style (second video, blog entry)
            p we strike a deal with <a href="https://twitch.tv/badcop_">badcop</a> (explorer of dangerous fields) for 2 cured villagers in the wild, explore the bastion with dii, and actually get close to making the villager breeder work actual except SERVER DRAMA ?? happens and we were set back and our dreams were seemingly crushed
            p however while mining for more diamonds we stumble upon a secret mineshaft and another chance in forms of dungeon chest is handed to our souls
            p to prevent future disasters we move our base to <a href="https://twitch.tv/LCOLONQ">SKYFORT LCOLONQ</a> and then make farms in preparations determined to at least get the villager thing working until the server closes
            p eventually the governing party (<a href="https://twitch.tv/JakeCreatesStuff">jake</a> and <a href="https://twitch.tv/badcop_">badcop</a> mostly) realizes how horrible the seed is and scuff their way into expanded borders, actually including villagers and strongholds this time and also making our shit kind of obsolete now
            p regardless, we manage to stay completely within the original border and get the thing finally working (we get 2 villagers at the end of stream)
            p we then do dragon fight and other outro related stuff (we were left behind in the outro so we arent in the final picture)
            p <a href="https://twitch.tv/JamsVirtual">raid</a>
        .card
            p we are "back so soon" as we delve into the 60 topics that occured in this short span of history, we talk about minecraft, yume nikki and various other situations that occured in the last 4 days, also huge <a href="https://twitch.tv/Meisaka">meisaka</a> raid
            p during minecraft talk the theory behind "prod craft" has been expanded, where it would be a "all cheats allowed" kind of server where people "build robots" and "program for fun" - but also it has "ic2" and its "somewhere between alpha 1.0 and release 1.7.2 lol"
            p we also talk about "meteor", and get to know one of the new Off-Screen guy appearance by maradyne. all that after we finally start getting into the Real Deal of "the incident"
            p in the pre-stream time, ctrl_o's entire user data blew up and disappeared into thin air - leaving us with "absolutely nothing", to combat this we devised a plan to "not do this": every end of stream now user data is backed up to some "cloud" where it is secure, and to aid this we added a !takeout command that allows you to download your own data (gdpr compliant??)
            p and then asquared reads prod's data and uses the screen vulnerability of Using ID As Token to gain access to the entire system (and the entire pc by extension) and starts messing with things, spawning windows and shouting out various people
            p we make logging better and then also vows to install some security measures for next time (we do)
            p <a href="https://twitch.tv/s9tpepper_">we were going to let asquared choose raid target but alas</a>

            p we are so swamped for this entire month (and NO GAME this year?? despair despair despair despair despair)
            p we make guy stats :3 (wins, losses, shulker boxes opened)
            p <a href="https://twitch.tv/ExpiredPopsicle">raid</a>
        .card
            p new years incoming ! this is last stream
            p we listen to 3 whole versions of the same song
            p we then talk about the island style (new human cosplay unlocked) &amp; the "banter discussion" we had on <a href="https://twitch.tv/LCOLONQ">lcolonq</a>
            p during this we also discover that we are not really 10 viewer and it is in fact so over, vowing to delete channel permanently or sotn

            p prod NEW WIRES begin where we go and review people
            p the format is in the form of "broken clips fetcher" where we see prerendered clip of 1 guy and then talk 1 docket entry so on so FORTH
            p there is like a billion tangents the following is a very very brief shortening of what happened:
            ul

            p since this point 2kki is constantly on (xor and nichepenguin gets many screentime in 2kki)
            p we talk about how my allocation of time has changed and now i hang out in twitch due to lack of project abundance
            p we also talk about the leetcode sammi idea but we discover sammi is too good and instead vows to make calculator in opus magnum someday
            p we also showcase justkirb hardrop and create "diagram"
            p a question of "follower" comes up, we determine that follower count actually has nothing to do w popularity or viewercount and is just indication of age + "viral moment"
            p ENERGY READING: we discuss our fall from grace as ascension was inturrupted by a combination of Post-Project Emptiness, Gastrointestinal Attack and "e era" (moodswings) - and how i have managed to resolve all by "going outside" and "touching grass" but in process i got "hit by a bike" and now im on "plaster" lmao (i feel still so good going outside op) (we also play tetris with damaged arm)
            p in terms of todays meat courtesy of witscord user NormalExisting we figure out we may be doing fucked things w raylib and harassing our gpu, turns out it was indeed correct
            p we actually implement "max fps limit" and "vsync" on our engine to resolve this issue and gpu usage goes down from 80% to 3% (lol)
            p we continue noita and explore a good bit of fungal, no digspell yet tho

            p prod ACTUALLY HAS ACCESSORY NEW: juicebox from <a href="https://twitch.tv/digi_shell">digishell</a> streams
            p we talk about <a href="https://twitch.tv/ManakaRei">manaka</a> tower for a moment before following up on the followerbit from last time: why does twitch care for followers? we determine there may be some emotional component of "nebulous growth" since people are unlikely to unfollow and follow count is very unlikely to go down
            p we showcase gizmo from <a href="https://twitch.tv/Venorrak">venorrak</a>, <a href="https://twitch.tv/mickynoon">mickynoon</a> and <a href="https://twitch.tv/KinskyUnplugged">kinskyunplugged</a> and confirm resolution is being done (2 checked now)
            p we were indeed at <a href="https://twitch.tv/lala_amanita">lala anniversary</a> as said in previous lore, i was so nervous lol bc ppl were riffing and loudness and my tism was saying no but i have Social Slayed and we kind of went on hard style for 16 hours (and then slept and went immediately back live for 20 hour total)
            p we take the homestuck classpect test (we become Heir/Page of Light) and played karkalicious and shadow recites the bible (its complicated)
            p for todays meat we do the great stickboy poll of 2025 (<a href="https://twitch.tv/rotsuki">rotsuki</a> wins) and laments how poll is not as interactive, and we vow to port this to screen
            p things take a turn for the worse as we start adding more and more videos such as Keys Jangling, Samsung Notification, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWvqRr7I-lc">rotsuki Creepypasta Land</a>, FNAF Mimic Song, Entire Discography of Annoying Orange, Audiojungle, Lofi Girl, Caramelldansen and Metal Pipe 10 Hours. we also tune up every audio fx and go crazystyle. programming under extreme duress. we cannot escape until we finish our goal.
            p we eventually does (productivity was harmed greatly) and we had some time left so we went on noita, we tried the connoisseur orb and died immediately bc we teleported wrong LOL
            p we still had 30 minutes left tho and this was a first time in ever so we went into this mythical "post-gaming" world where i just went on vc and asquared made irc on stream while <a href="https://twitch.tv/LCOLONQ">lcolonq</a>, nulligor and i talked
            p we talk about "x posting", "oauth protocol" and "chinese tiktok", get raided by <a href="https://twitch.tv/abby_the_lesbiab">abby</a> and talk about the origins of startellers (the kr newgrounds stuff) again
            p <a href="https://twitch.tv/SaladForrest">saladforrest</a> joins the chat and i notice forrest is literally streaming and is watching us on stream so we watch them in return and immense feedback loop happened and we raided onto <a href="https://twitch.tv/rotsuki">the twiggest stickboy of 2025</a> (proven by poll)
        .card
            p prod actually exports emotes in real time while stalling for yap (they are becoming real streamer (scary))
            p we deliver good news of "big ram"
            p we discuss the features of being rectangular (i am rectangular) and how this has been foretold in the lands of mexico (korea) to begin with
            p speaking of having no hole we also discuss <a href="https://twitch.tv/SaladForrest">forrest</a> meltdown stream &amp; the furry hole question
            p speaking of meltdown we discuss energy reading and how i got 3 "comms" and one of them may "delay the resolution" due to its size but i want it bc its genuinely probably helpful for my future
            p speaking of energy reading i talk about caffeine/sugar induced e era return briefstyle and dealing with this via gender victory 
            p speaking of gender victory i showcase the 20 song playlist i make every year and how it destroyed my voice forever
            p speaking of 20 song we also showcase the new playlist of opening songs you can access on the vod channel
            p speaking of showcase the new vod channel we introduce 6 new emotes for usage
            p today we are game style, we make pause menu and volume sliders
            p <a href="https://twitch.tv/ManakaRei">manaka</a> noita session was supposed to be yesterday but it was delayed due to sickness, and now we are at an impass and we resolve this by literally having her on the corner of our dev session for one and a half hours lol
            p people discover technology of "farming <a href="https://twitch.tv/JakeCreatesStuff">jake</a> for infinite level" and gain a large quantity of hp and attacks
            p we end 30 minute before we supposed to and since we played noita before we just call it early &amp; <a href="https://twitch.tv/ManakaRei">go watch her for real</a> this time
        .card
            p this broadcast is first of the three "we go insane on 2kki entire week" series where we collab with different people and do various things in 2kki
            p in this installment we bring <a href="https://twitch.tv/BrighterMalphon">malphon</a> and <a href="https://twitch.tv/lala_amanita">lala</a> channel in their first* time 2kkiing (*malphon has done 2kki once before with <a href="https://twitch.tv/kogorinvt">kogorin</a> but has not done much)
            p we get some effects, go to left path, Critter, Night Train to Rainy Apartment, and then also visit Star Building.
            p during the zone we talk about ... rotating echidna genitals ... and other equally Interesting stuff
            p this zone was very much not par for course with our usual livestream due to the guests involved and them being put in "Social Slay" situation but we have talked our way through and got to share a lot of things
            p i would say go check it out if you're not repulsed by all the sex jokes but the Vod is AGE RESTRICTED . yeah.
            p we did a collective raid on <a href="https://twitch.tv/sakumintsu">sakumintsu channel</a> who were literally reading an 18+ yaoi fic (real) on stream so like yeah
        .card
            p this broadcast is second of the three episode series, where we do the "preparations" for "shrimp push" in digizone (and more). we have done prep on digizone yesterday but this is second prep.
            p we gathered effects, money, and deposited the money to be prepared.
            p while people were clicking 1.3 hours of donation box, we also filled in some captions in <a href="https://pub.colonq.computer/~prod/yume">YNO diary</a> entries hosted in pubnix. we are like a year behind the diary isnt even updated to when i first met digi or clonk and thats like more than a year back now
            p DURING the stream, <a href="https://twitch.tv/Tyumici">tyumici</a> debut has occured and we join in to say hi and all this
            p we made the overlay green and did the delay bit also it was kind of a weird zone
            p overall we got like 2 more people ready for "shrimp push", raid <a href="https://twitch.tv/Tyumici">i mean we gotta raid our Man</a>
        .card
            p this broadcast was supposed to not exist in fact, and we were just going to do an after dark discord sesh
            p but in the last moment prod decides to push that live button and a barely boned prod appears to do ... programming ???
            p this is the final episode of 2kki push where <a href="https://twitch.tv/digi_shell">digi</a>, <a href="https://twitch.tv/rotsuki">uro</a>, <a href="https://twitch.tv/Wolfborgg">wolfborgg</a> and others push for the mythical shrimpzone.
            p while this was going on, i did not in fact push for shrimp, but rather opened up local 2kki instance and CHEAT ENGINE to confirm that what we are doing is in fact correct and is not bugged/plausible.
            p we looked into various assembly zones and opened like 50 new windows that slowly covered up the screen including the two broadcasts that were doing the shrimp push. uro broadcast in specific was quite funny in that he was straight up watching wendigoon lethal company video and we watched it in the corner too by proxy
            p in the end we barely hold ourselves together and discover that indeed this is possible, and the corner peek strat is real, and the required number is V#2 == 65536.
            p the reason why this vod is not up is because due to the unique stream setup of 50 windows and tight schedule we had to improvise and add a bunch of window captures on OBS which subsequently leaked our entire shit (my steam profile and whatnot) and this happened enough times PLUS multiple corruption from "out of disk space" where editing it out became kind of weird, so it is forever sealed in my "unreleased vod folder" as a first ever entry
            p we declare that we have achieved our goal and <a href="https://twitch.tv/rotsuki">actually go watch wendigoon together</a>
        .card
            p after the frenzied week, prod has spent the entire wednesday sleeping and has just enough energy to eek out a thursday stream
            p we first view that kettlestew is creating a noita mod that adds !guys ??? so epic ...
            p today's theme is "the wires HEAL and return to normalcy", and as such the docket format RETURNS to google slides for a rare time (s0 throwback)
            p we discuss the 2kki happenings and ALSO the like 6 commissions i took bc i was dumb and clicked paypals big blue button and funneled all my money to an illiquid account (:3) and how it completely de-boned them
            p we also talk about "the change of prod" and how extroverted i have became out of sheer will
            p we talk about the new tetr update (reverse card) and how fucked it is
            p todays meat is GAME (again), we are making "lock and key" by making a "locked" element to a block so that any squareish elements can be opened by keys of corresponding color.
            p during development we finally get fed up with Hitbox Misalignment and fix hitbox detection once and forever - now the mouse is actually accurate forever regardless of lag
            p raid <a href="https://twitch.tv/Psychic_Refugee">INSANE that we havent raided you yet</a>
        .card
            p after the previous pod at thursday prod goes to <a href="https://twitch.tv/SaladForrest">forrest</a> twitchtv to chill out and hang out with friend. however something insane happens...
            p we were talking about sniffing out bald vibes from names and how prod can be bald (during replay we do see a little bald prod and its kind of Bad)
            p it starts with asquared out of complete randomness talking about "<a href="https://twitch.tv/lala_amanita">lala</a> is a bald name", and prod happened to be multidexing and things begins to spiral
            p "the sources" brings up the foot emote situation, in which she confirms that there is not 3 but 4 foot emotes on the game available. forrest is extremely confused
            p soon lala hops on forrest stream and puts it on stream - establishing The Link that starts it all
            p conversation ensues *through* the stream delay as they ask questions and answer 5 seconds apart from each other, which goes like, "do you have bald?" "oh shit bald!" "what is this feet business?" "i can show you feet"
            p they then go into discussions about bald people and strength levels - and also "loam measurements"
            p this is also the time where forrest start <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq1MD2l2XIc">money affirming</a> - and this becomes a huge thing as double affirmations ensue
            p they DO get stepped on which is memorialized forever in the forrestcord (<a href="https://twitch.tv/ericplaysbass">eric</a> is very happy and grateful for this)
            p and then <a href="https://twitch.tv/KinskyUnplugged">kinsky</a> goes live for development - in which they are roped in immediately and now the back and forth becomes THE TRIANGLE
            p kinsky plays mostly the sanemen in this group as they have 0 idea whats going on and gets affected by The Voices
            p and then <a href="https://twitch.tv/bigbookofbug">bigbookofbug</a> goes live ???? we rope her in too ?? the loop becomes forrest &gt; lala &gt; kinsky &gt; bbob &gt; forrest and the full loop is now here
            p various commotion in regards to elder scrolls and Soup has been exchanged (is pasta better than soup ??)
            p the bit reaches ultimate climax as METEOR HAPPENS in bbob stream and the soundwaves propagate through the entire loop shocking everyone to the CORE (making plants and shit)
            p we also relay the basecamp (the pod !discord) reaction as this unfolds and its kind of insane, 4 way money affirmation happens
            p eventually the loop begins to slow down as people start putting more and more overlay elements that block the screen making passthrough harder and harder - there was an attempt to rope <a href="https://twitch.tv/catdeersnooz">snooz</a> into the group but this has largely gone fruitless
            p we had some chats and everyone involved seemed to enjoy it so this was kind of a huge w on the pod zones, we then hanged out in basecamp planning our next "tree stream" (4x up root)
            p outside of the loop discussion, we go on "9$ ramen" tangent which is like crazy how do us people live (it is less than 3$ in kr) and how top ramen chicken sucks
            p we also finally close out the soup and pasta debate as discussion was borderline impossible by the time it was brought up
            p we also talk about "greencircle" and how people were scared of joining it due to "vtubers suck" "(at reaching out to ppl)" and then tomaterr calls us out for making up groups of people for content and prod goes through a lifechanging introspection mid stream going dormant
            p finally there was another idea that is similar to tree stream where we "swap gizmo" with each other - having someone else run the !screen for a day and whatnot, if this catches on we make a giant chain that goes all the way to jblow or smth
            p prod leaves with the ominous message: "LUNAR NEW YEAR TOMORROW" - little do they know this will be the last time they will be seen boneful in januaRy.... 
            p raid <a href="https://twitch.tv/walfas">holy shit walfas</a> ??? (we get double raided (classic))
        .card 
            p today starts with RANDOM ISSUE as discord loads default theme - turns out prod.kr did not reboot correctly LOL
            p today is "fast docket" because we declare dockets has been getting "too long"
            p we briefly mull over the tomaterr incident before talking about "three" that has happened - LCOLONQ front page anniversary etc etc special (that is surprisingly NORMAL ???)
            p we then talk about the real issue of the problem - the ultimate trans-bone issues of LUNAR NEW YEAR and what having 6 different hardships thrust upon me does (i throw up and get extremely ill and powerless also ruin all my routine)
            p in the meatzone is GAME saga once again, gotta do it once per week at least where we this time make "custom keybinds" real and refactor a couple different spots
            p prod is so boneless here LOL personally im skipping this vod its fine
            p raid <a href="https://twitch.tv/finisfine">finisfine</a> (cool guy)
        .card
            p to repent for previous episode prod goes ULTIMATE LCOK IN stage where we discuss: whois.mom ????
            p but unfortunately none of the people who we are talking about are here to listen as JANUARY LIFE strikes all of us like METEOR - malphon has confirmed to have gone vodzone for this
            p but before then we discover the jam games of <a href="https://twitch.tv/vesdev">vesdev</a> and <a href="https://twitch.tv/badcop_">badcop</a>s <a href="https://badcop.itch.io/clark-the-spark">game jam game</a> that is very cool 
            p todays docket: WHO IS <a href="https://twitch.tv/BrighterMalphon">BRIGHTERMALPHON</a>: who is he?
            p we were on twitch tv a lot this week and also on vc a lot so we talk about those mostly
            p before an entry even begin we establish two core pillars of twitch: [femboy] and [mommy] thanks to <a href="https://twitch.tv/DankTownBunny">"dank.town"</a>
            p entry 1: who is NORTHERNLION: what is "man rizz"?? this question was brought up and never resolved, i think the closest solution we got to is "big guy, protective, traditional gender appeal is kind of toxic" and "prod is too gray and lesbian to understand this" - but still crowns <a href="https://twitch.tv/Tyumici">John YIIK</a> the title of ultimate man rizzler
            p but this veers off into a zone thanks to a comment made 3 hours before stream in the <a href="https://twitch.tv/lala_amanita">lalazone</a>: what is "sexy" anyways ??????? ?????? we decide that sexy is "engenders a need to do EXPERIMENTS on them" - and declares <a href="https://twitch.tv/KinskyUnplugged">kinsky</a> the rizzmaster
            p we also look into the related zone of "cuteness" - and the Bro do you Watch FWMC style issue?? where women r infantalized and in vtuber space way moreso n its kind of weird
            p for the last of this weird side tangent zone we look into the history of Mushroom Girl Cavern and how i realized im just repulsed by Straight Flirting on vtuberzones (oops)
            p who is WORM: we talk about the recent development in the <a href="https://twitch.tv/bigbookofbug">bbob</a> WORMZONE ... worm is NOT bug ?! we talk about the survey (thank you <a href="https://twitch.tv/BugVT">bugvt</a>), the MYSTERIOUS RIDDLES , and his(malphon) DECLARATION FOR WORM (damnation)
            p who is TRENT TIMOTHY: we also talk about the nightmare state that i am in occasionally and how it is quite odd that i dream of weirdly naturalistic and depressing bc capitalism scenarios and then we talk about maplestory private servers
            p finally we go into ENERGY READING: the energies are quite odd as prod talks about how many fucking shit happened in january (a lot ) and how ive just became normal again in sacrifice of <a href="https://twitch.tv/JakeCreatesStuff">jake</a>'s event (i am deeply sorry jake) and big sleeps
            p for todays meat we are making MOVING BLOCKS real - this is quite a daunting task as many moving parts exists for this. thankfully they have prepared ALL DESIGN and all they have to do is implement....
            p quite predictably we go over the designated 4 hours and then everything start to detiriorate ?!! we run out of disk space like 3 times, prod gets significantly eepy, windows keeps breaking down, but we trudge through the dampness and get the basic functionality there (and also refactor the whole optimization system by necessity) in the 6:30 mark (i think this is the record aside from "craft" ?!)
            p we vow to return to catch the stragglers and raid onto <a href="https://twitch.tv/TheKanMan">kanman</a> zones
        .card
            p prod is actually productive for once and did a few things pre stream, notably volume is now category controllable
            p but then their emotions got fucked and warns a drastically weird stream (it was)
            p todays docket is a continuation of the previous bit, where we search stuff that isnt malphon. we start with a lil tetris improvement showcase
            p bug update: we watch a 9 minute vod of <a href="https://twitch.tv/bigbookofbug">bbob</a> book of bug zone where the TRUTH REVEAL: bbob turns out to be NO BUG and YES WORM ... we have censored the worm due to its upsetness
            p we then explore the discovery of new creature of the <a href="https://twitch.tv/YukieVT">long yook</a>, which confuses bugologizes due to its "cat worm" nature (incompatible qualities due to "cat is bug" and "worm is not bug")
            p maybe bug = worm ??? science is crumbling at the seams, comm1 also starts here
            p we then look at noita for a little bit where we craft some Wild Shit (play noita)
            p we are also on <a href="https://forum.tsuki.games/">tsuki</a> now (cool)
            p we finally get into the last and most important: the ROADMAP and how i had a crisis of faith
            p basically i get extreme motivated by recent increased activity / new friends / cool gizmo / vc with dank.town and decide to check out shindigs twitter
            p and i pump myself way up and start "over-networking" -- going hard on new ppl big zone and thinking of all gizmo expansion and even like partner pushing in season 4 for fun in a single day or smth idk
            p the crux of all this issue is that none of this is really what i want - "talking with friends" - during this brief moment i have taken this fact for granted and did not think of the implication of said expansion
            p they once again promises that none of this will rly happen &amp; if it gets to a point where such goal is unattainable in zone they will explode (the channel)
            p for meat we do startellers continued - making curved tracks and blocks stick to tracks. they thought this would be a simple enough task that they can do a long docket, but a surprising enemy attacks: the BIG EEPY
            p for the next like 2 hours prod struggles to become even real as reality blurs and speeches become infrequent, i would suggest skipping this part if not for the fact that various HAPPENINGS happen
            p 1 - caram3lnuke has finally achieved !big and bring !big upon the lands - obstructing EVERYTHING in its wake as god intended
            p 2 - a perfect "guy stasis chamber" is introduced where the vortex consumes all
            p 3 - xor !os moments happen again and mentions of "adjacent gizmos" were brung up, we may want to reveal everything in api(NOT ws) v soon
            p eventually we *kind of* make it work n declare victory, said system is cleaned up "offstream" before next streams beginnings
            p raid <a href="https://twitch.tv/zhunGamer">zhun gamer channel</a> and literally immediately collapse (we then talk afterwards in <a href="https://twitch.tv/manakaRei">manaka</a> discord LOL)
        .card
            p as soon as we begin prod introduces the new gizmo that was worked on pre stream style: it is an improved camera with pixelation customization and various other
            p <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/lala_amanita">lala</a> was going to study on this day and as a bit we do a "lofi girl" thing where as soon as she joins we becomes black screen rain asmr and lofi music
            p docket time ok ENERGY READING: prod expresses a sense of "tire" from all the comms that has been happening and laments the fact that i cannot speak of any of them due to the fact that they are "comm" and "secret style"
            p gender reveal: <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/brightermalphon">malphon</a> gender is now "powerbottom" (official) and lala gender was temporarily "bald" (we kept secret of this until here)
            p we also talk about "<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/mickynoon">mickynoon</a> gas leak" where he does an audible obs toggle click (this haunts him to this day)
            p todays notepad segment is about "vtubers with virtual spaces" in accord with <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/mdxcai">mdxcai</a> re appearance style, and how having a space your guy resides in beyond a simple overlay is quite cool and may be of exploration
            p we also make plans for upcoming birthday stream and also 1 year stream and potentially we may do a gizmo jam ?? idk
            p this weeks meat was portfolio zone where we filled out the updated risk of rain area but we end up being too sleeby and doesnt do a lot lol
            p raid <a href="https://twitch.tv/Outfrost">outfrost</a>

            p we pick up effects and visit mosenite and somehow a new connection from there ?? we also go to 825 areas 
            p we briefly say hello to <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/digi_shell">digishell</a> area that was also streaming 2kki and we also spot <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/rotsuki">rotsuki</a> there i think
            p we do a belated docket after ellg leaves where we talk about how we are so low energy nowadays and idk what to do w it
            p we may switch up the formula ?? idk but they were kind of in "we need to put on good show" mode (foreshadowing)

            p prod has a new accessory and its the party hat (cone style this time) and this is bc it is birthday stream as announced before

            p but even before we step 1 time parsec mouse sharing turns out to suck ass mega and works in a horrificbad way, we struggle for 20 good minutes trying to do audio setups turning mouse share on and off and almost accidentally revealing my shit to the public (epic style) (this is actually the fun bit you should watch this part)
            p lala goes into like 200 ping and also funny parsec moment and struggles to beat stage 2 for like 20 minutes, we beat stage 3 and wrap up
            p from startellers demo they feel a few things: the physic engine has been improved a lot and vows to creates a netcode thing because international play is not good
            p today stream idea is we play videogame people around us has made, this includes a lot of puzzle game due to "wit cord", the game we play is thus in order:

            p something something parasocialism, something something "it is fun to be boring"
            p for todays meatrealms we do a various house keepings around the zones, including finally fixing the emotes on discord, putting tealcircle in hollow decks, and writing api docs that we made on the apiarea week ago.
            p ironically what they thought was the easiest task became the hardest bc discord is a great platform and does not explain anything on their error message, thank you discord
            p after a chill 1 hour overtime and a slight eepymoment we finish the tasks and had a lot of good talks, actually quite a good session this time

            p northernlion segment: korean traditional clothes kind of goes hard
            p we go into meatrealm 45 minutes in (quick!), todays meat is <a href="http://witsend.witscord.net/">"witsend"</a> - a new witscord gizmo we will hook up to our zone in a partial one way bridge type thing
            p but because its just ws and witsend protocol is so easy we do this in like an hour tops and we have !ws working, you can also !login and do commands in witsend also (witsend is now autopiped into twitchchat/discordchat/etcs)
            p we spend another hour tackling another panic project (<a href="http://ianhenderson.org/">panic</a> joins us around here), where we implement <a href="http://ianhenderson.org/0rise.html">!0rise</a> for timezone modes, we understand what 0rise is doing algorithmically and do the reals
            p we STILL have an hour left so we play a videogame DPS made (a take on 3d tetris) and fill out a form for game feedbacks, we endure the distractions insane style
            p raid <a href="https://twitch.tv/RamnorTheWanderer">raqmnor channel</a>
        .card
            p prod is on they "ai dog washing" era we talk about this
            p prod was on many collab last week we talk about the appearances where its like alien stage with snooz and also rabit with forrest
            p we also talk about the vague notion that "tealcircle was detrimental to my productivity" n show off like a lot of thing everyone is doing
            p we also made lala chat (instead of streamelements they are WASD.unpack)
            p meat realm: we are finally doing "BLESS 3" :: we are making a whole language that people can "run program" in
            p the goal is to add "send chat" function and connect it to c#gizmo, allowing "programmable guy" 
            p for now we are "arithmetic" style where we just try to make basic calculation work
            p because this project will be Massive were being extra unlike ourselves and actually doing some organizing ??? making Clean Code ???
            p we make a state machine based scanner and also a "sweep" based evaluator, making it work 30 minute over the 4h mark
            p raid <a href="https://twitch.tv/ConditionBleen">bleen channel</a> and then immediately went to confront parent about an important stuff didnt even say hello goddamn
        .card
            p prod has largely been sleeping and has no docket entries but "we can actually talk about the school situation" which develops into a 2h+ docket major entry
            p idk how to even describe but straight up 7 years of double betrayal crypto startup ai art class bureaucratic nonsense and korean education system just listen to the vod lmao
            p for meat we continue off the previous session and showcase the new Modular Refactoring where every small bits is split into like their own files
            p we spend the last 2 hours recovering previous session's progress and then almost misses college ??? (from now on prod has to leave 4h at every thursday session or they die)
            p raid <a href="https://twitch.tv/teal_XavierCrow">teal</a> and then literally immediately took off for uni didnt even clean my desk after
        .card
            p prod has returned with a better mood this time, various updates were had before all began
            p 7tv update: still not moderator approved (even if 7tv seems to allow Anything)
            p tealcircle update: we fix the "double trap exit feed" situation but also lcolonq feed should now be 100% reflective
            p gob update: gob turns out to be "team pangrea" but also we find the true alignment of saladforrest???
            p this is around the time we start becoming more and more chattercontrolled:tm: where the conversation goes into a direction of "orb tower", looks cool
            p but then we go into this roguelike hole and the existence of "bloons roguelike" and also "mahjong soul roguelike mode" ??? and likke the game design aspect of it
            p after we slowly regain we talk about the "tetris tarot collab"
            p then we go into snooz bald moment and imply a maybe "blender moment" to be real
            p people's general sentiment around discord is "i lost the plot" so we take the time to explain the current "movie situation", including Gorge Gun, Monkey Tree and French Naturo
            p we also lament the state of modern streaming services 
            p and then we also make witsend messages less prevalent to differentiate them from normalzones
            p we continue our bs zones to "list mode" as we create list creations and access
            p we also create "variable assignment" and "semicolon" for multi line facilitation
            p we decide to go dictmode "off stream" and will return with "lambda mode" next time
